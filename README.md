# Multi Armed Bandit

Homework #2, Interactive Learning Course, University of Tehran

In this exercise, we present a model based on the **Multi-Armed Bandit** problem for a real-world problem.

Our problem is to maximize the commission and profit from allocating loan facilities to different customer groups of a bank.
In this exercise, we first present a model based on the **Multi-Armed Bandit** problem for our problem.
In the following sections, we will discuss the implementation of different algorithms for solving the Multi-Armed Bandit problem, such as `Epsilon-Greedy`, `Gradient-Based` and `Upper Confidence Bound`.
